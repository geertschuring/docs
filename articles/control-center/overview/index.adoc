= Overview

Control Center is a specialized tool designed specifically for managing Vaadin applications on Kubernetes clusters. It's a practical solution for developers and administrators who need to deploy, monitor, and manage their Vaadin applications effectively.

With Control Center, deploying your Vaadin application to a Kubernetes cluster is straightforward. You can easily move production builds to the cluster or discover and adopt any existing Vaadin applications so you can start managing your applications right away, without the need of manual deployments and configuration. Control Center makes it easy to set up and manage the resources your Vaadin application needs. Whether you're setting up databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB, setting up identity providers like Keycloak, or adding visualization tools such as Grafana, Control Center simplifies these tasks so you can focus on your application rather than the underlying infrastructure.

Control Center offers Identity Access Management (IAM) by connecting your Vaadin application with identity providers to manage user access and authentication, making it easier to control who has access to your application and their permissions. It also offers monitoring of an application's performance, and identifying potential problems and helps to discover vulnerabilities in your application's dependencies, keeping your application safe and up-to-date.

In summary, Control Center is all about giving you a straightforward way to manage your Vaadin applications on Kubernetes. It handles the complexities of deployment, resource management, security, performance monitoring, and user management, so you can focus on developing and improving your application.
